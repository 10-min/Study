in this weeks I can learn about the variables and basic expressions.

- Ex2_1a     
  Read 4 integers, print each the number of four integers. e.g. read 1234, print 1 2 3 4
- Ex2_1b    
  Read a temperature in Fahrenheit and print in Celcius
- Ex2_2
  Read a line of text, and first word change with last word and capitalize a first character, and print
- Ex2_3a    
  Read the price of an item in cents: a multiple of 5 between 25 and 100, i.e., 25, 30, …, 95, or 100     
  Assume you paid a dollar, and print the number of quarter (25cents), dime (10 cents), and nickel (5 cents) coins for the change
- Ex2_3b     
  Read the radius (in inches) and the depth (in feet) of a well casing (1 foot = 12 inches)      
  Compute the volume of water (in gallons) in the well casing, and print it (𝑉=𝜋𝑟^2 ℎ, 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons)      
  E.g., a 300-foot well with a radius of 3 inches holds about 440.6 gallons of water
